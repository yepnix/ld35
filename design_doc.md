# LD35 WIP (Theme: Shapeshift)
## The Masks We Wear
There’s a large part of me that wants to handle shapeshifting in the _metaphorical_, rather than the _literal_, so I’m going with an idea that puts that interpretation into the spotlight. 
### Overview
In this world each person wears one mask; it embodies their outlook, as well as informs others’ perceptions of their self. You, however, have multiple masks. You’re able to transcend the singular perspective and choose how you present yourself and how you interpret others. 
> **Personal note:** a few things occur to me at this point:
> 1. Try not to co-opt real-world cultural depictions of masks.
> 2. This could be a metaphor for my own struggles with identity.
> 3. Either leverage the power of color meanings or discard it entirely.
> This should prove interesting to make, if not only for the game aspect.
### Game Objective
The primary objective is to navigate a social space while having access to multiple distinct perspectives according to the player’s whims. Secondary objectives might be emerge as player interacts with said space (see game through using only one mask, etc.).
### Mechanics
1. Talking/examining
	- Primarily, the player will be talking to individuals or examining objects. 
	- Talking will provide players with basic choices of dialogue.
	- Examining provides players with a basic description, maybe some interaction options.
	- This is all modified by masks.
2. Masks
	- Player has access to at least two masks.
	- Masks change visuals and text choices/results.
3. Walking
	- Basic movement will also be necessary.
	- This also necessitates basic collision detection.
4. Environments
	- Looking at a minimum of two environments
	- Starting with a party, lots to interact with in multiple contexts
We’ll see what else crops up during development.
> **Personal note:** Having only completed one video game before, I’m really trying to pare down what’s necessary to get the idea across. I’m also planning on improvising a lot more than will be set down in this document.
### Design Objectives
It’s another attempt of mine, this time in digital format rather than tabletop, to create a meaningful experience that leaves the player with something to think about. Experiences in games mean more to me than most other experiences, as I’ve stated in the past, so I want to share that joy with others. Perhaps there will be points of indecision about which mask to use; perhaps none will fit right and cause frustration. 
In any case, the experience will be valid because of its open-ended nature. It’s my sincerest hope that I come out of this with something to point toward as “my kind of game,” rather than something like Elemêlée. While it is a cause worthy of celebration that I finished a game, I’d like to shoot higher in this attempt.
